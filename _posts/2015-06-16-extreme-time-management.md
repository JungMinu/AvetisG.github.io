title: "Extreme Time Management"
---

In my humble opinion, if you are starting your career as a software developer and planning on making it as your path of mastery then you need to put in hours into coding outside of your job.

Some people will totally disagree with this statement saying that one needs to enjoy one's life, there are other things more important than programming and that it is all about balance. 

My answer is **extreme time management**.

Try out a mini experiment for 30 days. 

Go ahead and count how many hours you are actually tossing away on watching TV, playing video games, procrastinating and in general just not being very productive. 

You will be astonished - trust me. 

I thought I was a very productive guy myself and then after this experiment I found out I wasted 5+ hours each day on very unproductive tasks. That's a lot of time!

What I have tried doing in order to solve this problem is **compressing my time** by conditioning my mind to take **less breaks**.

This helps me get a momentum going and actually get things done faster and in a more effective manner.

> The more things you have to do the more you get done and the more time you seem to "create" for yourself. 

Where does this time come from? Pretty much from all the hours during which we all procrastinate (As you have seen from my own example). 

It takes time to get used to this pace but overtime as you get used to it you will be able to code more outside of work and do other things as well (or code more!).

In order to show you a real example, which you can use or modify as you wish, I will bring forth my own schedule and hope that it helps you find your own.

* After I wake up and get into my car I start listening to an audio book of my choice (can be anything as long as you enjoy it and it engages your mind). The key here is to wake your mind and put it in an active, engaged mode to set yourself up for the rest of the day. A small accomplishment such as learning a few new things from the audio book can get you up and ready for a bigger accomplishment. I use Audible's mobile application for all this.

* Once I get to work my mind is charged and ready to start solving problems - I am already in the [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29 "flow state") and all I need to do is maintain it. The key here is not to get distracted. Even if you get distracted by meetings or anything else that is out of your control - just accept it and go with the flow because if you get mad that will actually put you out of your flow state. However, by accepting your distraction you get to maintain your flow state. Better yet if you decide to participate fully in whatever that distracted you from your original task you will increase your flow state even more.

* After work I always go to the gym immediately so that I don't have time for "let me take a little break before I go to the gym" excuse. 
 
> I keep myself moving - this accelerates my thinking and builds my momentum even further.

* After the gym I come back home and I commit myself to solving at least one problem before going to sleep. I usually find problems to solve from [CodeEval](http://codeeval.com/ "CodeEval"), [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com/ "HackerRank"), [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/ "CodingBat") and other great places which are full of challenging problems. The key is to not concentrate on how many problems you have solved but HOW you have solved the actual problems. Were you able to look at it and see the solution? Did you plan it out correctly before going about coding? Did you use a pen and a pencil instead of an IDE? Quality is key here.

* Sometimes when I don't want to be working on challenges I go ahead and refactor my previous open source projects or try to think/start new ones that can potentially use technologies I want to learn about.

This is my schedule in a nutshell. I do take time off at times when I feel like it, however the main point of all this is to put the pressure of growing onto yourself. 

Even if you love programming there are going to be times when you are going to be questioning yourself if it is the right thing to go with. 

Love for the subject alone won't do so you have to combine it with dedication and consistency along with extreme time management in order to grow that love for programming into a fully blossomed mastery of your craft.

I am nowhere near this but my daily actions are all directed towards this goal. I was fortunate enough to have people around me that have mastered their own crafts and it definitely helped me go after my own.

After you get used to doing this you will have two choices - either make it a lifestyle or treat it like a short-term challenge. This purely depends on your preferences and your goals.

My personal suggestion would be to make this a lifestyle, because if you are trying to master this craft then extreme time managmenet is your best ally (which could also be used in any other area of your life).

Before I end this blog post I would like to leave you with one thought - we as humans are like quantum super computers yet on a daily basis we use ourselves as we are old Atari 520STs from 1985 (Nothing wrong with Atari but you get the point :D).
