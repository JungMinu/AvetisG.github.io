For as long as I could remember I have thoroughly enjoyed the process of designing and building. As I grew up I was lucky enough to be surrounded with intelligent minds, who happened to be brilliant programmers.

When I was 8 years old I began experimenting with QBASIC. Guided by my mentors, I applied my passion for design to computer programming. 

My inspirations were all of the people who have mastered this art - who had a childlike passion for their profession. 

Later in my career I was fascinated by professional software developers who also had an entrepreneurial mindset. Their hunger for knowledge, far-sightedness, and innovation was extremely contagious.

While researching about this new field that was a combination of software development and entrepreneurship I came across a term called microISV or an independent software vendor. Right there and then I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do.

After learning enough information about microISVs I was overwhelmed by a very strong desire to try and create my own product. At that time I was at my first job as a software developer right out of college and I started simultaneously working on my own product during any free time I had.

After reading more books about marketing, sales, and new technologies that I needed to use for this product - the end result came to be [www.AvocadoPlugins.com](http://www.AvocadoPlugins.com) which exists to this day and is a marketplace for WordPress plugins.

It took me a year and a half of dedicated coding, focused learning and iterative understanding of new ideas in order to launch my product and start making passive income.

In my eyes this is just the beginning, however the biggest thing I got out of that experience was the understanding of what I really love to do.

I love researching a specific market and finding a need, I love iterating on solutions, innovating a product, owning the product and collaborating with other like-minded developers, writing clean code, having an extremely organized workflow, marketing the product with unique and creative strategies, growing a fan base and so much more.

I believe that even if every software developer doesn't want his/her own product/business her/she should at least try to go through this process ones. It teaches one so much more outside of software development such as customer services, marketing, sales and other skills that would make one a more valuable asset even while working within a company.

My main goal for now is to keep mastering software development as a craft both through my own personal projects, projects at work and finally through competitive programming. My end goal is to fund my own startup.

Overall, I am thoroughly convinced that the best professionals, in any field, are the ones who first and foremost have fun with what they do on a daily basis - the ones who haven’t forgotten the childlike enthusiasm they once had for their craft.

This in turn helps an individual to grow and develop constantly, stay positive and be a better person in general.
